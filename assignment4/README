# Application Name 

The applications are to implement operations of the dynamic array, simple set and the files,
the operations of the dynamic array are insertion, deletion, clear and so on, the operations
of the simple set are union, intersection, subtraction and so on, and the simple set class 
inherited from the dynamic array class. The operations of the files are to load from the file
to the dynamic array or simple set, and save the dynamic array or simple set to the file. 
The application names are dynamicarray and simpleset.



## Technologies

Creating and using Dynamic Array class.
Creating and using Simple Set class.
Creating class constructors, destructors, copy and move constructors, and copy and move assignment operators.
Overloading operators (+, -, *, ++, --, [], >>, <<).
Using friend function.
Using inheritance.
Overriding inherited function.
Using runtime polymorphism with virtual function.
Using ifstream and ofstrem to read from and write into files.
Organizing C++ application into appropriate folders.
Separating the specification from the implementation.
Writing the applicationâ€™s main function in a separate file.
Generate separate object files from all the source files.
Linking the object files into single executable file.
Writing Makefile to aid in building the application.
Building (compiling and linking) the application using make.
