# Application Name 

The application is to implement sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quick).
It can read data from file and sort the data with these sorting algorithms, then save the sorted 
data into another file.


## Technologies



Implementing sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quick).
Using pointers, references, and dynamic memory allocation.
Using ifstream and ofstream to read from and write into files
Organizing C++ application into appropriate folders.
Separating the specification from the implementation.
Writing the applicationâ€™s main function in a separate file.
Generate separate object files from all the source files.
Linking the object files into executable files.
Writing Makefile to aid in building the application.
Building (compiling and linking) the application using make.


## Build and Installation


cd assignment2
make all

the executable files are generated in assignment2\bin.
